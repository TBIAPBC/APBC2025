(Algorithms and program development for biological chemistry)

This git repository serves as a platform for information, sharing course material, communication, and submission of coursework.

Students of the class shall work on different assignments and ---finally--- on a team project. The assignments are generally described in README files in the subdirectories A'n'; submission is generally done via git/GitHub.

The warm-up assignment in subdirectory A0 demos this scheme and explains the submission via GitHub (including preparations). Follow this assignment to get started.

Feel free to discuss via pull request comments (in particular, assignment-specific stuff) or GitHub issues for all more general things. Don't forget to mention the people you want to address (e.g. @\<user\> for a particular GitHub user or @TBIAPBC/APBC2025 for all).

Assignments and Provisional Schedule
------------------------

Individual assignments, together with a preliminary schedule are listed below. Generally, __solutions are due at 10:00 AM on Mondays before the next meeting__ (where we will discuss the solutions and present the next assignment). Please submit your solutions ahead of time.

Mondays before the next meeting should be used for code review and feedback on your colleagues' submissions. __Everybody is supposed to provide code review and feedback__ during the semester. Your feedback will help your colleagues and is supposed to stimulate collaborative work which will be an asset during the final team project.

Upon receiving code review and feedback, you are encouraged to commit code revisions before our Tuesday meetings.

Please note: As we will meet on Tuesdays, the latest possible date for submission is on Mondays at 09:30 AM. Please find the assignment descriptions in the respective subdirectories.
